# weather-app

## Description

I wanted to create an app that a user could look up the 5 day forecast for an upcoming trip. They should be able to type in a city and have the weather displayed for the next five days.
## Usage 

Go to the weather app website and type a city in the search bar. click the search button and the 5 day weather forecast will be displayed.
